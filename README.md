# WinForms Desktop Application (Learning Project)

## 📌 Overview
This project is my first complete desktop application built using **C#**, **Windows Forms**, and **SQL Server**.  
It was developed as part of my learning journey in **programming fundamentals**, **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, and **database-driven applications**.

The goal of this project was to understand how a real application is structured from UI to database, rather than to create a production-ready system.

---

## 🧱 Project Structure
The solution is organized into multiple layers to separate responsibilities:

- **UI Layer**  
  Windows Forms interface and user interaction.

- **Business Logic Layer (BLL)**  
  Application rules, validations, and core logic.

- **Data Access Layer (DAL)**  
  Database communication and SQL queries.

This structure was chosen to practice separation of concerns and maintainability.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- C#
- .NET Framework / .NET (WinForms)
- SQL Server
- Windows Forms
- Visual Studio Community

---

## 🗄 Database
The repository does **not** include a real database file.

Instead, it contains:
- `create_tables.sql` – SQL script to create the database schema  
- (Optional) sample data script for testing

> Before running the project, create a database and update the connection string accordingly.

## ⚠ Notes
- This project reflects my skill level at the time of learning.
- The code may contain design and architectural limitations.
- The repository is kept to demonstrate learning progress and growth.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Refactor code for better design patterns
- Improve validation and error handling
- Convert the project into a web application using **ASP.NET Core**
